# Comments
</br>

Comments are explanatory information that you can include in a program to benefit the reader of your code. The compiler ignores comments, so they have no affect on a program.

A comment starts with a slash asterisk **/*** and ends with an asterisk slash ***/** and can be anywhere in your code.

Comments can be on the same line as a statement, or they can span several lines.

```c
# include <stdio.h>

/* Hello World C program
*   Version 1.0
*/

int main() {
    /* Output Hello World String */
    printf("Hello World!");
    return 0;
}
```
```
Hello World!
```
</br>

> As you can see, comments clarify the program's intent to the reader. Use comments to clarify the purpose and logic behind segments of code

</br></br>

# Single-line Comments
</br>
C++ introduced a double slash comment // as a way to comment single lines. Some C compilers also support this comment style.

```c
# include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 12; //int for a whole number

    //%d is replaced by a
    printf("%d", a);
    
    return 0;
}
```
```
12
```
</br>

> Adding comments to your code is good programming practice. It facilitates a clear understanding of the code for you and for others who read it
